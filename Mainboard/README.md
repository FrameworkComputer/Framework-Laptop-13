# Framework Laptop Mainboard Pinouts

This is a list of connectors on the Framework Laptop Mainboard and the pinouts for them.
Note that not all signals listed in each pinout are actually connected on any given
version of Mainboard.  These are the overarching definitions of the pinouts with some
considerations for future generations that may or may not utilize the additional signals.

## Webcam Interface

IPEX 20879-030E connector used to interface to the Webcam Module.  Note that the Webcam Module
itself currently only uses a 12 pin connector using pins 19 through 30.  The remaining signals
are not connected.

## Display Interface

IPEX 20879-040E connector used to interface to an eDP display.  Note that there are signals
defined for both USB 2.0 and I2C touchscreens.  There is a PWM interface to control backlight
brightness, but the display currently used on the Framework Laptop converts that to a DC LED
control.  Note that pin 1 is on the left when looking at the receptacle on the Mainboard.

## Audio Board Interface

Hefeng AFC42-S15FMA-R3 ZIF connector that goes to the board that has the 3.5mm audio jack
as well as the hall effect lid sensor.  Note that there are likely other 15 pin ZIF connectors
that will work with the FFC we use, but these would be untested.

## Speaker Interface

Hefeng AWA02-S04FIA-HF connector for the Speakers.  Note that there are many other footprint
compatible 4-pin connectors that are likely compatible. This kind of connector is also known
as "JST SH", and has a 1.0 mm pitch. The same connector is used for the Fan.

## Input Cover Interface

Amphenol 10156000-051100LF connector for the Input Cover.  This includes signals
for the Touchpad, Keyboard, and Fingerprint Reader. The mating connector for it
is 10156001-051100LF.

Caution: this pinout is Framework schematic-specific, using a symbol with odd-even numbering.
It doesn't translate directly to the Amphenol connector footprint numbering - which is
counterclockwise. Amphenol connector numbering is shown in the "Conn" column.

- [1] The connector has two KBL_P pins - in order to increase current capacity. They're created from +5VS rail.
- [2] Connected to the +5VS (switched) rail through a 0 ohm resistor
- [3] Connected to the +5VALW (always-on) rail through a 0 ohm resistor
- [4] FPR_CTRL is used to filter out power button presses while the fingerprint sensor is scanning
- [5] The EC drives these LED's through low-side transistors. The RGB channels from the EC drive the white, green, and red fingerprint LED's, respectively.

## Fan Interface

Hefeng AWA02-S04FIA-HF connector for the Fan.  Note that there are many other footprint
compatible 4-pin connectors that are likely compatible. This kind of connector is also known
as "JST SH", and has a 1.0 mm pitch. The same connector is used for the Speakers.

## RTC Battery Interface

NOTE: The mainboard will charge this battery, so a rechargable ML1220 battery MUST be used.
For example, CR2032 MUST NOT be used, it cannot be charged and will likely be damaged.

RTC battery is used for storing persistent but resettable information.
This includes the time and DRAM training. Disconnection will result in deletion of that information.
If no battery is connection, DRAM training needs to happen on every boot, slowing down the boot process significantly.

### Onboard RTC Battery

Framework 13 Intel Core 11th through 13th Generation use an onboard coin cell battery as RTC.

We use the Lotes LOTES_AAA-BAT-046-K01 connector.

### RTC Battery Cable Connector

On AMD Platforms and starting with Framework 13 Intel Core Ultra Series 1, no RTC battery is included anymore.
Settings are kept alive by the normal system battery. The only case where an
RTC battery is recommended, is when the system is used in standalone mode (without a battery).

Cvilux CVILU_CI4402M1HRC-NH connector for the RTC Battery.
